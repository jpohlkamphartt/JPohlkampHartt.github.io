Born and raised in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada, I developed dual passions that would shape my career: athletics and mathematics. From age 12, I aspired to work in NHL statistics; a dream I'm privileged to fulfill today as the Associate Director of Analytics for the Boston Bruins.

My athletic background includes competing at high levels in multiple sports, playing university football and lacrosse, and serving as a Canada Games alternate for Nova Scotia in hockey. These experiences fostered my understanding of the dedication required to excel at the highest levels of competition, while teaching me valuable lessons in perseverance and teamwork.

Academically, my enthusiasm for mathematics led me to Queen's University, where I discovered my affinity for statistics and data-driven analysis. After completing my undergraduate mathematics degree, I continued at Queen's to earn both Master's and Doctoral degrees, studying under Dr. Thompson and Dr. Takahara. My research encompassed Time Series and Spectral Analysis across diverse fields including Cognitive Radio, Cardiology, Commodities Pricing, and Sports Analytics.

During my final doctoral year, I collaborated with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League as their Director of Analytics for the 2014-2015 season, which culminated in a chapter of my thesis. My research produced innovative approaches to measuring neutral zone play, optimizing line combinations, and quantifying in-game player performance.

Following graduation, I joined Apple in San Francisco as a statistician working on Apple Maps. There, I contributed to groundbreaking projects in route optimization, autonomous sensing and reconstruction systems, and geo-spatial hypothesis testing. Notable accomplishments included leading teams for the global launch of indoor maps and public transportation features.

Since the 2018-2019 season, I've had the privilege of serving the Boston Bruins, developing impactful models, metrics, and analyses for hockey operations. My philosophy centers on enabling data-driven decision-making within the organization. During my tenure, the Bruins have achieved significant milestones, including the best regular season record in league history, two Presidents' Trophies, and advancement to the Stanley Cup Finals.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a dedicated marathon runner and avid amateur electronic musician. My music is available through the link provided on my contact page.
