**Welcome!**

I'm Josh, a statistician and sports enthusiast from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada.

This site serves as the collection of my interests and ideas. All opinions and ideas are my own unless stated otherwise.

On the navigation bar you can find links to my publications, biography, contact information and less formal writing.

Many thanks to my partner Liisa for all her support, physical and mental!
